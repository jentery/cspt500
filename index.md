# Media and Materiality

*From Marx to Barad, how are media defined? Under what assumptions about materiality? To what effects on interpretation?* 

## Week 1 | 13 September | Motivations for the Seminar 

Why a seminar on media and materiality, now? What is the relationship between this seminar and historical materialism? Realism? Media archaeology?  

Read: Walter Benjamin, ["On the Concept of History"/"Theses on the Philosophy of History" (1940/1974)](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/benjaminTheses.pdf)

Case study: Cornelia Parker, ["Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View" (1991)](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/parker-cold-dark-matter-an-exploded-view-t06949)

## Week 2 | 20 September | Ephemerality + Indexicality 

How does ephemerality endure? What do media point to? How does memory differ from storage? From inscription? How do all three manifest through archives?
