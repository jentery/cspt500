title: On Media + Materiality + Materialism 
desc: An overview of terms and contexts
---

To start the seminar, I want to discuss some core terms, to which we'll repeatedly return. To do so, I'll draw upon W.J.T. Mitchell's ["Addressing Media"](http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/1771) to ask some questions that will allow us to articulate media and materiality with questions of agency.  

If we begin with materialism (including historial materialism's emphasis on modes of production), then we might ask ourselves whether: 

* Anything is immediate, including experience; 
* Any medium is a pure medium; 
* Media are merely their material support or base (Mitchell 2008: 3); and
* Media are really just social practices (3; also see Williams, *Marxism and Literature*). (Here, there's also Mitchell's variant, "Is every social practice a medium?" [3])

Following these questions, we might ask how we describe or, better yet, *locate* media. For instance, if we follow Mitchell's illustration of the vase (9-10), which I'll draw on the board, then: 

* Where are object and matter? 
* Where are form and medium? 
* Where are system and environment? 
* How do systems or forms "face" each other?
* Where are conduits and containers? 
* Where are frame and portal?
* Where are vision and illustration? 

This discussion will prompt a final set of questions, which are more about materiality than media: 

* Where and what are the textures at hand? 
* What escapes? What persists? How does change happen? 
* How do we copy or remediate it? 
* How do we address it, and how does it address us?
