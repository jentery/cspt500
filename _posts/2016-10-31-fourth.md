title: Reading Media in Theory 
desc: Some questions for defining material 
---

The role of media in theory is quite expansive and thus difficult, if not impossible, to isolate. For one, the definitions and uses of media are historically and socially contingent. In one instance, media are carriers or vehicles; in another, they are containers or vessels; in others, they may be everything from matter and apparatuses to messages and relations. They may be alive or inert, compliant or resistant, figure or ground, middles or ends, autonomous or entangled, things or bodies, portals or frames, instruments or agents, ideas or practices, phenomena or noumena. Of course, my use of "or" throughout that last sentence may be problematic. In many cases, "and" may be more appropriate. And if we look at mentions from the 1800s forward, "media" is frequently synonymous with "material," too. It's a mess, really. But it's a mess that prompts us to study how mediation is theorized and theory is mediated. 

Below, then, are some questions we might ask while reading media in theory. I've contextualized them a bit by asking, at least for the moment, how media function as physical substances, objects of inquiry, and mechanisms for articulation and differentiation. (Apologies in advance for the bad habit structure of three.) These questions correspond with certain paradigms (e.g., idealism, historical and cultural materialism, formalism, phenomenology, semiotics, hermeneutics, symptomatics, media archaeology, feminism, labour, and realism), which do not cohere. In fact, there's a lot of tension and contradiction there. However, I have decided to foreground the questions themselves, with little attention to which query corresponds with which -ism. This way, you can select aspects of the questions that may apply to your interests and approaches, fill in the gaps, and also consider which positions do not resonate with your own practices and experiences. 

I've also drawn only from what we've read thus far: Marx's [Notebook M](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm) (1857) and [Fragment on Machines](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch13.htm#p690) (1858), Simmel's [*The Philosophy of Money*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/simmelMoney.pdf) (1900/78), Shklovsky's ["Art as Device"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/shklovskyDevice.pdf) (1917), Benjamin's ["Theses on the Philosophy of History"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/benjaminTheses.pdf) (1940/74), Arendt's [*The Human Condition*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/arendtHumanCondition.pdf) (1958), Merleau-Ponty's ["Eye and Mind"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/merleauPontyEyeMind.pdf) (1961/93), Barthes's ["From Work to Text"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/barthesText.pdf) (1971/77), Foucault's [*The Archaeology of Knowledge*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/foucaultArchaeology.pdf) (1969/72), Williams's [*Television*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/williamsTelevision.pdf) (1975), Cixous's ["The Laugh of the Medusa"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/cixousMedusa.pdf) (1975/76), and Lorde's ["Uses of the Erotic"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeErotic.pdf) (1978/84) and ["The Mater's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeTools.pdf) (1979/81). Of note, we have yet to discuss work by Kristeva, Butler, Moten, Sedgwick, Chun, Doane, Grosz, Brown, Appadurai, Debray, Krauss, Haraway, or Barad. Soon, we should also write about who is missing from this outline and which works and perspectives should be added to it. I'm looking forward to that moment. For now, the questions . . . 

## Media as Physical Substances

In critical theory, a pressing question of media and material is how people compose theory and how those compositions circulate. We usually associate critical theory with writing and language via text on the page. Of course, other materials, including screens, paper, ink, computers, file formats, pens, pencils, images, and word processors, may be involved, too. There's also the fact that theory may draw from data, collections, archives, and other historical sources. Plus, composition depends on bodies, power, and context; people aren't minds who write or communicate immaterially, impervious to all forces or independent of socio-economic support. As such, the everyday may play a central yet ignored (or disavowed) role in theory's production. Here are some questions along those lines. 

* To what degree does the work at hand foreground its medium or material? For instance, is text simply a means to convey ideas, or does it demand attention as an inscription or face? In the case of the latter, many manifestos experiment with typography and layout to make their arguments. Text is more like an image in this instance; it addresses us and resists reduction to mere container or carrier. It gives texture, if you will, to ideas. Or, drawing from Shklovsky's critique of poetry's dependency on prose, text may defamiliarize ideas by disrupting the automation of sensual labour and interpretation (e.g., from recognition to vision) to highlight the creative process over the artifact itself.     

* To what degree does the work privilege language or words as media? This issue is less about typography, design, or layout and more about the use of irony, poetry, ambivalence, language games, and even citation. Often, theory will speak to matters indirectly or elliptically, by analogy or with scare quotes. Or, it will cook up new terms that correspond with cultural formations and modes of performance it wishes to explore or imagine. In this seminar, we might compare the writing style of Arendt with that of Simmel, for instance, or Cixous with Williams. Quite a contrast! What terms are coined and why? When does a word or phrase mean multiple, perhaps contradictory things at once? When does a term resist definition or translation (or when must it be read in the original language)? What are the aesthetics of theory (e.g., playful, opaque, elliptical, musical, direct, pedantic, repetitive, assertive, macro, micro, nano), and how do those aesthetics enact or resonate with its cultural and social positions? These questions do depend on the design or inscription of words; however, they are mostly about how those words various signify and refer. From some perspectives, such polysemy exceeds its material (the signifier, word, or image) through the embodied labour of reading, speech, interpretation, dialogue, performance, etc. Or, from other perspectives, such labour necessarily escapes (or is lost) when we try to record or inscribe it. Instead of focusing on loss or gain (or source, original, and copy), we might privilege change across these versions and performances.   

* How does the work share, acknowledge, or point to the materials and labour upon which it relies? When an image or painting is examined, is it included in the work as a figure? Are captions provided? If so, then what do they include? How does the argument direct us, if at all, to archives and collections? With how much detail or provenance? When are primary sources translated, and into which languages? Is the work authored alone or collaboratively? Under which names? Primary author aside, whose labour went into the work? Who edited, translated, or printed it? How are the first, second, and third person used to make arguments? How are readers interpellated? To what degree does the author rely on arguments from experience? We might consider Merleau-Ponty and Benjamin on painting/images here. How do we see what they saw? How is vision embodied for them, or how is it also labour? Where is that labour located? Or there's Foucault's archaeology, which often approaches documents and monuments in a rather abstract way, premised on unique vocabulary (e.g., statements, positivities, and material repeatability). There's Lorde's critique of the master's tools, too; it underscores not only arguments from experience but also the labour on which academic work, patriarchy, and feminism depend. 

* How does the work at hand change over time and across venues? How does it correspond with its initial inscription or dissemination? Are we reading an edition? A translation? A book? An article? A web page? What changes from page to screen? Was the original work a talk? Was it a draft? Was it meant to be circulated during the person's lifetime? How and where is it archived? In this instance, Lorde's talks, Marx's notebooks, and Benjamin's theses come to mind. Many works of critical theory are treated as complete, as wholes, when they are really fragments or parts of a (life's) work in progress. Of course, arguments and perspectives may change across an oeuvre.
