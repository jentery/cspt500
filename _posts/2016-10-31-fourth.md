title: Reading Media in Theory 
desc: Some questions for defining material 
---

The role of media in theory is quite expansive and thus difficult, if not impossible, to isolate. For one, the definitions and uses of media are historically contingent. In one instance, media are carriers or vehicles; in another, they are containers or vessels; in others, they may be everything from matter and apparatuses to messages and relations. They may be alive or inert, compliant or resistant, figure or ground, autonomous or entangled, things or bodies, instruments or agents, ideas or practices, phenomena or noumena, situated or in between. And if we look at mentions from the 1800s forward, "media" is frequently synonymous with "material." It's a mess, really. Still, it's a mess that prompts us to study how mediation is theorized and theory is mediated. 

Below, then, are some questions we might ask while reading media in theory. I've contextualized them a bit by asking, at least for the moment, how media function as physical substances, objects of inquiry, and mechanisms for articulation and differentiation. (Apologies in advance for the obvious use of three.) These questions correspond with certain paradigms (e.g., idealism, historical and cultural materialism, formalism, phenomenology, semiotics, hermeneutics, symptomatics, media archaeology, feminism, labour, and realism), which do not cohere. However, I have decided to foreground the questions themselves, with little attention to which inquiry corresponds with which -ism. This way, you can select aspects that may apply to your interests and practice, fill in the gaps, and also consider which positions do not resonate with your own methods and experiences. 

I've also drawn only from what we've read thus far: Marx's [Notebook M](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm) (1857) and [Fragment on Machines](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch13.htm#p690) (1858), Simmel's [*The Philosophy of Money*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/simmelMoney.pdf) (1900/78), Shklovsky's ["Art as Device"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/shklovskyDevice.pdf) (1917), Benjamin's ["Theses on the Philosophy of History"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/benjaminTheses.pdf) (1940/74), Arendt's [*The Human Condition*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/arendtHumanCondition.pdf) (1958), Merleau-Ponty's ["Eye and Mind"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/merleauPontyEyeMind.pdf) (1961/93), Barthes's ["From Work to Text"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/barthesText.pdf) (1971/77), Foucault's [*The Archaeology of Knowledge*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/foucaultArchaeology.pdf) (1969/72), Williams's [*Television*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/williamsTelevision.pdf) (1975), Cixous's ["The Laugh of the Medusa"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/cixousMedusa.pdf) (1975/76), and Lorde's ["Uses of the Erotic"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeErotic.pdf) (1978/84) and ["The Mater's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeTools.pdf) (1979/81). Of note, we have yet to discuss work by Kristeva, Butler, Moten, Sedgwick, Chun, Doane, Grosz, Brown, Appadurai, Debray, Krauss, Haraway, or Barad. Soon, we should also write about who is missing from this outline and which works and perspectives should be added to it. I'm looking forward to it. Now, for the questions . . .
