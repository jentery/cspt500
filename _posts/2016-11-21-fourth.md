title: Reading Media in Theory 
desc: Some questions for defining material 
---

The role of media in theory is expansive and thus difficult, if not impossible, to isolate. After all, the definitions and uses of media are historically and socially contingent. In one instance, media are carriers or vehicles; in another, they are containers or vessels; in yet another, they are intervening substances. They may be everything from matter and mechanisms to messages, relationships, and interfaces. They may be active or inert, compliant or resistant, figure or ground, middles or ends, autonomous or entangled, things or bodies, windows or frames, nature or culture, feminine or masculine, instruments or agents, ideas or practices, text or texture, fleeting or permanent, elemental or concrete, phenomena or noumena . . . the list goes on and on. Of course, my use of "or" throughout that last sentence may be part of the problem. In many cases, "and" is far more appropriate. 

*And* if we look at mentions from the 1800s forward, "media" is frequently synonymous with "material," often with negative connotations (e.g., "just the material" or "merely media"). It's a mess, really. But it's a mess that prompts us to study how mediation is theorized and theory is mediated. These are important matters, and by the term's end I'm asking you to speak to your own positions on them, including your interpretation of how media and materiality inform your research, methods, and lived experience (e.g., what you study, how you study it, how you share your work, how you practice or perform that work, how you identify and steward your sources, how you distinguish between this and that, or how you determine the cultural, social, and political issues that matter most to you).   

Below, then, are some questions we might ask while reading media in theory. For now, I've contextualized them by asking how media function as "compositions," "objects of inquiry," and "apparatuses." (Apologies in advance for my bad habit, this three-act structure before you.) These questions correspond with certain paradigms (e.g., idealism, historical and cultural materialism, formalism, phenomenology, semiotics, hermeneutics, symptomatics, archaeology, feminism, labour, affect, and realism), which do not cohere into a single theory or worldview. In fact, there's a lot of tension and contradiction there. However, I have decided to emphasize the important questions that emerge from dialogue between paradigms, with little attention to which question corresponds with which -ism or label. This way, you can privilege practice by selecting aspects that apply to your interests and approaches, fill in the gaps (and there are many), and also consider which aspects resonate (or don't) with your own experiences. Discard and revise what you wish. This is not a step-by-step guide.  

In presenting these questions, I've drawn only from what we've read during seminar: Marx's [Notebook M](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm) (1857) and [Fragment on Machines](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch13.htm#p690) (1858), Simmel's [*The Philosophy of Money*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/simmelMoney.pdf) (1900/78), Shklovsky's ["Art as Device"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/shklovskyDevice.pdf) (1917), Benjamin's ["Theses on the Philosophy of History"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/benjaminTheses.pdf) (1940/74), Arendt's [*The Human Condition*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/arendtHumanCondition.pdf) (1958), Merleau-Ponty's ["Eye and Mind"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/merleauPontyEyeMind.pdf) (1961/93), Barthes's ["From Work to Text"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/barthesText.pdf) (1971/77), Foucault's [*The Archaeology of Knowledge*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/foucaultArchaeology.pdf) (1969/72), Williams's [*Television*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/williamsTelevision.pdf) (1975), Cixous's ["The Laugh of the Medusa"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/cixousMedusa.pdf) (1975/76), Lorde's ["Uses of the Erotic"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeErotic.pdf) (1978/84) and ["The Mater's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeTools.pdf) (1979/81), Kristeva's [*Powers of Horror*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/kristevaAbjection.pdf) (1982), Butler's [*Gender Trouble*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/butlerGT.pdf) (1990), Moten's [*In the Break*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/motenBreak.pdf) (2003), Sedgwick's [*Touching Feeling*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/sedgwickTF.pdf) (2003), Chun's ["Did Somebody Say New Media?"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/chunNewMedia.pdf) (2006) and ["The Enduring Ephemeral"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/chunEnduringEphemeral.pdf) (2008), Doane's ["The Indexical and the Concept of Medium Specificity"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/doaneIndexical.pdf) (2007), Grosz's ["The Thing"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/groszThing.pdf) (2001), Brown's ["Thing Theory"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/brownBillThing.pdf) (2001), Appadurai's ["The Thing Itself"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/appaduraiThing.pdf) (2006), Haraway's ["Situated Knowledges"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/harawaySituated.pdf) (1988), and Barad's ["Posthumanist Performativity"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/baradPP.pdf) (2003). Since we haven't read them, I've excluded Debray and Krauss. 

As we proceed, you'll also write about who is missing from this outline and which works and perspectives should be added to it. I'm looking forward to that. For now, the questions . . . 

## Compositions 

In critical theory, an important question of media and material is how people compose theory and how those compositions (those "works") circulate. We usually associate critical theory with writing and language via text or words on the page. Of course, other banal materials, including screens, paper, ink, computers, file formats, pens, pencils, images, and word processors, may be involved, too. There's also the fact that theory may draw from data, collections, archives, interviews, ethnography, and other historical sources. Plus, composition depends on labour, power, context, and embodied experience; people aren't minds who write or communicate immaterially, impervious to all forces or independent of socio-economic factors (including institutional support). As such, the everyday (or habit) may play a central yet ignored (or disavowed) role in theory's production and performance (or, if you prefer, in what Arendt calls "action"). Here are some questions along those lines. Perhaps some of them are relevant to your own practices. Again, discard and revise what you wish.  

* **Design in Theory**: *To what degree does the work at hand foreground its medium or material?* For instance, is text simply a means to convey ideas, or does it demand attention as an inscription or face (e.g., typefaces)? How are we prompted to engage it? Are we asked to look at or through it? Is it forward? Responsive? Intuitive? Many works, especially manifestos and publications such as [Mediawork Pamphlets](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/mediawork/index.html) and [Vectors](http://vectorsjournal.org/issues/index.php?issue=7), experiment with typography and layout to make their arguments. Text is more like an image or even a sculpture in this instance; it addresses us and resists reduction to mere container or carrier. It refuses to be flat, too. It is not abstract information (not Doane's medium without materiality, and not Appadurai's instrument of representation). It gives texture to ideas. It is the tactile or visible stuff of writing, not Barthes's methodological field (Text with its upper case "T"). For Sedgwick, such texture makes nonsense of dualisms (e.g., author and audience; active and passive), and it cannot be explained away as a shape or structure (e.g., we must consider repetition, feeling, and folds, too). Elsewhere, Shklovsky criticizes poetry's dependence on prose, implying that text may defamiliarize ideas by disrupting the automation of sensual labour and interpretation (e.g., from recognition to vision) to highlight the creative process over the artifact or work itself. From this position, textual or graphic design is mostly insignificant; text is merely a medium to carry or rehearse a poetic form, which transcends the sensuous material of inscription, book, type, and page. **Key point**: *Design in theory matters because it influences how people/publics are invited into writing while also giving us a sense of how authors perceive the arrangement, texture, setting, and expression (or, taken together, the materiality) of their own theories.*       

* **Aesthetics in Theory**: *To what degree does the work privilege language or words as media?* This issue is less about typography, design, layout, or even form and more about the use of irony, poetry, ambivalence, language games, and citation. Often, theory will speak to matters indirectly or elliptically, by analogy or with scare quotes. Or, it will cook up new terms (e.g., see Butler and Moten) that correspond with cultural formations and performances it wishes to explore or imagine. In this seminar, we might compare the writing style of Arendt with that of Kristeva, or Cixous with Williams, or Benjamin with Chun, or Simmel with Barad. Quite a contrast! What terms are coined and why? Which "flourishes" are fundamental to the theory expressed? When does a word or phrase mean multiple, perhaps contradictory things at once? When does a term resist definition or translation (or when must it be read in the original language)? What is the style of a theory (e.g., playful, opaque, elliptical, musical, direct, pedantic, repetitive, assertive, universal, global, situated, macro, micro, nano . . .), and how does that style enact or resonate with a theory's cultural, social, and political positions? These questions certainly depend on the design or inscription of words; however, they are mostly about how those words variously signify and refer (or, recalling Doane, how they variously point and trace). From some perspectives, such polysemy (deriving multiple meanings from the same word) exceeds its material (the word or image) through the labour of reading, speech, dialogue, performance, memory, etc. Theory demands interpretation, and that interpretation is embodied and situational: unique each time, it assembles or re-members fragments of text into meaning and understanding. Or, from other perspectives, lived experience necessarily escapes any attempt to record, inscribe, or commodify it as an object to be exchanged (see Appadurai, e.g.). Here, writing will fail to account for the richness of embodied action and perception. Something will be lost; something will fall flat. However, an emphasis on losses and gains, or originals and copies, inevitably faces its limits. We might instead privilege change across versions or performances of things. Here, Chun's distinction between memory and storage is very informative. Memory is performed, not archived; it is contingent, not stable. Moten's work on improvisation, phonography, and the transmission of materiality is also relevant. What happens, or what changes, between an event (or movement) and its symbolic representation? **Key point**: *Aesthetics in theory matter because they refuse to treat theory as information that is simply sent or received, delivered or deposited; they account for the ambiguities, contingencies, play, and even the poetry of critical work, which is not the product of authors/theorists alone.*   

* **The Index in Theory**: *How does the work acknowledge or point to the materials, conditions, assumptions, and routine labour upon which it relies?* When an image or painting is examined, is it included in the work as a figure? Are captions provided? If so, then what do they include? How does the argument direct us, if at all, to archives, collections, and people? With how much detail or provenance? When does a work translate its primary sources, and into which languages? Who conducted the translation, and upon what authority? Is the work authored alone, collectively, or collaboratively? Under which names? Primary author aside, whose labour went into the work? Who edited, translated, printed, circulated, or archived it? How are the first, second, and third person used to make arguments in the work? How are readers interpellated? To what degree does the author rely on arguments from experience to point to people, events, or things? To what degree do they assume critical distance from the people, events, or things at hand? We might consider Merleau-Ponty and Benjamin on painting and images here. How do we see what they saw (e.g., *Angelus Novus*)? How is vision embodied for them (e.g., *Denkbild* or the use of lines and colour)? How is that vision also labour? Where is that labour located (e.g., flesh and dialectical image)? Or, there's Foucault's archaeology, which often approaches documents and monuments in a rather abstract way (a vague pointing, if you will), premised on a unique or custom vocabulary (e.g., "statements," "positivities," and "material repeatability"). Or, we have Chun's evocative use of the Internet Wayback Machine in Figure 5: a skeleton full of broken links and images. Or, there's Moten's use of extensive footnotes (e.g., footnote 1, which is almost three-pages-long) as well as block quotations (e.g., of Douglass and Hartman). There's Lorde's critique of the master's tools, too; it underscores not only arguments from experience but also the labour upon which academic work, patriarchy, whiteness, and feminism depend. This labour is rarely acknowledged. **Key point**: *The index in theory matters because it foregrounds how a given work traces and points to who and what were involved in its production; it also reminds us that we cannot inhabit the positions of who or what we read.*   

* **Change in Theory**: *How does the work at hand change over time and across venues?* How does it correspond with its initial inscription or dissemination? Are we reading an edition? A translation? A book? An article? A web page? What changes from page to screen, or from manuscript to book? Was the original work a talk? Was it a draft? Was it meant to be circulated during the person's lifetime? How and where is it archived? In this instance, Lorde's talks, Marx's notebooks, and Benjamin's theses come to mind. Many works of critical theory are treated as complete, as wholes, when they are really (always?) fragments or parts of a (life's) work in progress. Of course, arguments and perspectives may change across an oeuvre, especially when we approach them as situated knowledge (Haraway) or as entanglements (Barad) with the unruly world of things (Appadurai). **Key point**: *Change in theory matters because it highlights the historical contexts and material instabilities of what we read; from this perspective, theory is neither autonomous nor continuous, and a given work has no single source or moment of genesis* (see Foucault, e.g.). 

## Objects of Inquiry 

In fields such as media studies and media theory, media are usually "objects of inquiry": the focus of study, the materials found in collections, the physical stuff of analysis. This already suggests that media can in fact be studied. They can be treated as content. It also raises questions about how media are rendered into objects: how and under what assumptions they are delimited, isolated, situated, examined, referenced, and archived. Once we start asking these questions, we must also consider how terms such as subject, world, setting, relation, and thing are defined and practiced, too.  

* **Media Studies in Theory**: *To what degree is a theory about or affiliated with a discipline?* Not all media studies publications overlap with critical theory. Still, many publications may work across the two fields, hence "media theory." Some theories may be about media (consider Chun, Williams, Doane, and even Simmel), while others may use media as examples in a line of inquiry (consider Butler, Barthes, Cixous, Kristeva, and Haraway). Where these publications fall in terms of field recognition will influence how people interpret them and what audiences expect of them (e.g., who and what are cited, which terms are taken for granted, and where and how "interventions" in existing research happen). **Key point**: *Media studies in theory matters because it stresses how disciplinary practices and expectations shape the content, methods, alignments, and arguments at hand.*

* **Specificity in Theory**: *How conceptual or granular is the treatment?* Media and materials may be studied from a variety of positions, from the abstract to the particular, via distance and/or immersion, through rationalism and/or empiricism. Does the work at hand underscore an intimate familiarity with materials and their use, or does it focus largely on concepts and ideas? Perhaps it does both (see Sedgwick, Barad, and Moten, e.g.)? How technical does the work get (see Chun, e.g.)? What is the goal of such technical treatment? In a given theory, do the particulars of media (e.g., how they work or function) determine their status as concepts (e.g., how they are perceived or described by society), or vice versa? Perhaps the particulars are entangled with concepts in messy ways? Or, echoing Sedgwick, we could interpret them beside (not before, beneath, or behind) each other; to interpret things beside each other privileges positions over origins. A key question, then, is which details matter most and when. Overly conceptual treatments may bypass the importance of history, embodied experience, and material composition, while overly granular treatments may fetishize the technical details (e.g., code or hardware) and ignore cultural/social implications (e.g., ideology and oppression). Related issues to consider include the use of "Technology," "Media," "Text," "Digital," or "Machine" (all in the upper case) when compared with the medium specificity (Doane) of, say, film's chemical base or a web browser's compiling process. By extension, are media treated in the singular or plural? Are they homogeneous? Whole? Do they determine or cause anything? Here, Williams's critique of McLuhan comes to mind. Williams accuses McLuhan of formalism, which allows television to be autonomous of specific material conditions and social practices; from a formalist perspective, technology has the same effects, regardless of situation or audience. **Key point**: *Specificity in theory matters because it demonstrates where authors locate the agency of materials, from the particulars of devices and mechanisms to the forms or concepts of Technology; specificity tells us which details matter, for whom.* 

* **Content in Theory**: *How is content defined and studied?* A significant amount of scholarly work parses materials and media from content, or the process of composition from the meaningfulness of the work. Does the theory at hand rely on such a demarcation? Is there a media/form binary? Writing/text? Technique/content? Matter/object? Labour/work? What assumptions or arguments do these demarcations afford? Which legacies of emphasis and categorization do they affirm or critique? Shklovsky's readings of Tolstoy are pertinent in this instance. Tolstoy's creative process and poetic devices are far more interesting than his work as artifact or content; processes and devices are more important to the experience of art. Or, we might consider Grosz's comparison between being enmeshed and having dominion. Is content (e.g., our object of inquiry) something we can isolate and examine? Or is it produced through us and our scholarship, including the methodologies and technologies we use? Or, if we return to Cixous, we see that she emphasizes what women's writing will do. Although content matters for her argument, she stresses writing as an action or movement (without lack). **Key point**: *Content in theory matters because it shows how/whether authors distinguish procedure and medium from the work or text, but also how much power, force, or influence they attribute to both process and product.*
