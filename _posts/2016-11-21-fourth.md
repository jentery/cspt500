title: Reading Media in Theory 
desc: Some questions for defining material 
---

The role of media in theory is expansive and thus difficult, if not impossible, to isolate. For one, the definitions and uses of media are historically and socially contingent. In one instance, media are carriers or vehicles; in another, they are containers or vessels, or they are intervening substances; in others, they may be everything from matter and mechanisms to messages, relationships, and interfaces. They may be alive or inert, compliant or resistant, figure or ground, middles or ends, autonomous or entangled, things or bodies, windows or frames, nature or culture, feminine or masculine, instruments or agents, ideas or practices, text or texture, fleeting or permanent, phenomena or noumena. Of course, my use of "or" throughout that last sentence may be part of the problem. In many cases, "and" may be more appropriate. 

*And* if we look at mentions from the 1800s forward, "media" is frequently synonymous with "material," often with negative connotations (e.g., "just the material" or "merely media"). It's a mess, really. But it's a mess that prompts us to study how mediation is theorized and theory is mediated. These are important matters, and by the term's end I'm asking you to speak to your own positions on them, including your interpretation of how media and materiality inform your research, methods, and lived experience (e.g., what you study, how you study it, how you share your work, how you practice or perform that work, how you distinguish between this and that, or how you determine the cultural, social, and political issues that matter most to you).   

Below, then, are some questions we might ask while reading media in theory. For now, I've contextualized them a bit by asking how media function as "everyday media," "objects of inquiry," and "apparatuses." (Apologies in advance for my bad habit: this three-act structure before you.) These questions correspond with certain paradigms (e.g., idealism, historical and cultural materialism, formalism, phenomenology, semiotics, hermeneutics, symptomatics, media archaeology, feminism, labour, affect, and realism), which do not cohere into a single theory or worldview. In fact, there's a lot of tension and contradiction there. However, I have decided to emphasize the important questions that emerge from their dialogue, with little attention to which question corresponds with which -ism or label. This way, you can select aspects of the questions that may apply to your interests and approaches, fill in the gaps (and there are many), and also consider which aspects resonate (or don't) with your own practices and experiences. Discard and revise what you wish. 

In presenting these questions, I've drawn only from what we've read for seminar: Marx's [Notebook M](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm) (1857) and [Fragment on Machines](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch13.htm#p690) (1858), Simmel's [*The Philosophy of Money*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/simmelMoney.pdf) (1900/78), Shklovsky's ["Art as Device"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/shklovskyDevice.pdf) (1917), Benjamin's ["Theses on the Philosophy of History"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/benjaminTheses.pdf) (1940/74), Arendt's [*The Human Condition*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/arendtHumanCondition.pdf) (1958), Merleau-Ponty's ["Eye and Mind"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/merleauPontyEyeMind.pdf) (1961/93), Barthes's ["From Work to Text"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/barthesText.pdf) (1971/77), Foucault's [*The Archaeology of Knowledge*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/foucaultArchaeology.pdf) (1969/72), Williams's [*Television*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/williamsTelevision.pdf) (1975), Cixous's ["The Laugh of the Medusa"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/cixousMedusa.pdf) (1975/76), Lorde's ["Uses of the Erotic"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeErotic.pdf) (1978/84) and ["The Mater's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeTools.pdf) (1979/81), Kristeva's [*Powers of Horror*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/kristevaAbjection.pdf) (1982), Butler's [*Gender Trouble*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/butlerGT.pdf) (1990), Moten's [*In the Break*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/motenBreak.pdf) (2003), Sedgwick's [*Touching Feeling*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/sedgwickTF.pdf) (2003), Chun's ["Did Somebody Say New Media?"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/chunNewMedia.pdf) (2006) and ["The Enduring Ephemeral"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/chunEnduringEphemeral.pdf) (2008), Doane's ["The Indexical and the Concept of Medium Specificity"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/doaneIndexical.pdf) (2007), Grosz's ["The Thing"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/groszThing.pdf) (2001), Brown's ["Thing Theory"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/brownBillThing.pdf) (2001), Appadurai's ["The Thing Itself"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/appaduraiThing.pdf) (2006), Haraway's ["Situated Knowledges"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/harawaySituated.pdf) (1988), and Barad's ["Posthumanist Performativity"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/baradPP.pdf) (2003). (I've excluded Debray and Krauss, since we haven't discussed them.) 

Soon, we'll discuss who is missing from this outline and which works and perspectives should be added to it. I'm looking forward to that. For now, the questions . . . 

## Everyday Media 

In critical theory, a pressing question of media and material is how people compose theory and how those compositions (those "works") circulate. We usually associate critical theory with writing and language via text on the page. Of course, other banal materials, including screens, paper, ink, computers, file formats, pens, pencils, images, and word processors, may be involved, too. There's also the fact that theory may draw from data, collections, archives, and other historical sources. Plus, composition depends on labour, power, context, and embodied experience; people aren't minds who write or communicate immaterially, impervious to all forces or independent of socio-economic factors (including institutional support). As such, the everyday (or habit) may play a central yet ignored (or disavowed) role in theory's production amd performance (or in what Arendt calls "action"). Here are some questions along those lines. Perhaps some of them are relevant to your own practices. Again, discard and revise what you wish.  

* To what degree does the work at hand foreground its medium or material? For instance, is text simply a means to convey ideas, or does it demand attention as an inscription or face? How are we prompted to engage it? Many works, especially manifestos, experiment with typography and layout to make their arguments. Text is more like an image in this instance; it addresses us and resists reduction to mere container or carrier. It is not abstract information (not Doane's medium without materiality, and not Appadurai's instrument of representation). It gives texture, if you will, to ideas. It is the tactile or visible stuff of writing, not Barthes's methodological field (Text with its upper case "T"). For Sedgwick, such texture makes nonsense of dualisms, and it cannot be explained away as a shape or structure. Elsewhere, drawing from Shklovsky's critique of poetry's dependence on prose, text may defamiliarize ideas by disrupting the automation of sensual labour and interpretation (e.g., from recognition to vision) to highlight the creative process over the artifact (e.g., the work) itself. From this position, text is a medium to create or rehearse a form, which transcends the sensuous material of book and page.      

* To what degree does the work privilege language or words as media? This issue is less about typography, design, layout, or even form and more about the use of irony, poetry, ambivalence, language games, and citation. Often, theory will speak to matters indirectly or elliptically, by analogy or with scare quotes. Or, it will cook up new terms that correspond with cultural formations and performances it wishes to explore or imagine. In this seminar, we might compare the writing style of Arendt with that of Kristeva, or Cixous with Williams, or Benjamin with Chun, or Simmel with Butler. Quite a contrast! What terms are coined and why? Which "flourishes" are fundamental to the theory expressed? When does a word or phrase mean multiple, perhaps contradictory things at once? When does a term resist definition or translation (or when must it be read in the original language)? What are the aesthetics of a theory (e.g., playful, opaque, elliptical, musical, direct, pedantic, repetitive, assertive, universal, global, macro, micro, nano . . .), and how do those aesthetics enact or resonate with a theory's cultural and social positions? These questions certainly depend on the design or inscription of words; however, they are mostly about how those words signify and refer (or, recalling Doane, how they point and trace). From some perspectives, such polysemy exceeds its material (the signifier, word, or image) through the embodied labour of reading, speech, interpretation, dialogue, performance, memory, etc. Or, from other perspectives, such labour necessarily escapes (or is lost) when we try to record, inscribe, or commodify it. (See Brown on latency and excess.) Instead of focusing on loss or gain (or source, original, and copy), we might privilege change across these versions and performances. Here, Moten's work on improvisation and the transmission of materiality is very informative. What happens between movement and symbolic representation?   

* How does the work share, acknowledge, or point to the materials, conditions, assumptions, and labour upon which it relies? When an image or painting is examined, is it included in the work as a figure? Are captions provided? If so, then what do they include? How does the argument direct us, if at all, to archives and collections? With how much detail or provenance? When does a work translate its primary sources, and into which languages? Who does the translation, and upon what authority? Is the work authored alone, collectively, or collaboratively? Under which names? Primary author aside, whose labour went into the work? Who edited, translated, printed, circulated, or archived it? How are the first, second, and third person used to make arguments in the work? How are readers interpellated? To what degree does the author rely on arguments from experience? On critical distance? When does the method appear scientific? We might consider Merleau-Ponty and Benjamin on painting and images here. How do we see what they saw (e.g., *Angelus Novus*)? How is vision embodied for them (e.g., *Denkbild* or the use of lines and colour)? How is that vision also labour? Where is that labour located (e.g., flesh and dialectical image)? Or there's Foucault's archaeology, which often approaches documents and monuments in a rather abstract way (e.g., a vague pointing), premised on unique vocabulary (e.g., statements, positivities, and material repeatability). There's Lorde's critique of the master's tools, too; it underscores not only arguments from experience but also the labour on which academic work, patriarchy, and feminism depend. This labour is rarely acknowledged.   

* How does the work at hand change over time and across venues? How does it correspond with its initial inscription or dissemination? Are we reading an edition? A translation? A book? An article? A web page? What changes from page to screen, or from manuscript to book? Was the original work a talk? Was it a draft? Was it meant to be circulated during the person's lifetime? How and where is it archived? In this instance, Lorde's talks, Marx's notebooks, and Benjamin's theses come to mind. Many works of critical theory are treated as complete, as wholes, when they are really (always?) fragments or parts of a (life's) work in progress. Of course, arguments and perspectives may change across an oeuvre, especially when we approach them as situated knowledge (Haraway) or as entanglements (Barad) with the unruly world of things (Appadurai).
