title: Reading Media in Theory 
desc: Some questions for defining material 
---

The role of media in theory is expansive and thus difficult, if not impossible, to isolate. For one, the definitions and uses of media are historically and socially contingent. In one instance, media are carriers or vehicles; in another, they are containers or vessels, or they are intervening substances; in others, they may be everything from matter and mechanisms to messages, relationships, and interfaces. They may be alive or inert, compliant or resistant, figure or ground, middles or ends, autonomous or entangled, things or bodies, windows or frames, nature or culture, feminine or masculine, instruments or agents, ideas or practices, text or texture, fleeting or permanent, phenomena or noumena. Of course, my use of "or" throughout that last sentence may be part of the problem. In many cases, "and" may be more appropriate. 

*And* if we look at mentions from the 1800s forward, "media" is frequently synonymous with "material," often with negative connotations (e.g., "just the material" or "merely media"). It's a mess, really. But it's a mess that prompts us to study how mediation is theorized and theory is mediated. These are important matters, and by the term's end I'm asking you to speak to your own positions on them, including your interpretation of how media and materiality inform your research, methods, and lived experience (e.g., what you study, how you study it, how you share your work, how you practice or perform that work, how you distinguish between this and that, or how you determine the cultural, social, and political issues that matter most to you).   

Below, then, are some questions we might ask while reading media in theory. For now, I've contextualized them a bit by asking how media function as "everyday media," "objects of inquiry," and "apparatuses." (Apologies in advance for my bad habit: this three-act structure before you.) These questions correspond with certain paradigms (e.g., idealism, historical and cultural materialism, formalism, phenomenology, semiotics, hermeneutics, symptomatics, media archaeology, feminism, labour, affect, and realism), which do not cohere into a single theory or worldview. In fact, there's a lot of tension and contradiction there. However, I have decided to emphasize the important questions that emerge from their dialogue, with little attention to which question corresponds with which -ism or label. This way, you can select aspects of the questions that may apply to your interests and approaches, fill in the gaps (and there are many), and also consider which aspects resonate (or don't) with your own practices and experiences. Discard and revise what you wish. 

In presenting these questions, I've drawn only from what we've read for seminar: Marx's [Notebook M](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm) (1857) and [Fragment on Machines](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch13.htm#p690) (1858), Simmel's [*The Philosophy of Money*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/simmelMoney.pdf) (1900/78), Shklovsky's ["Art as Device"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/shklovskyDevice.pdf) (1917), Benjamin's ["Theses on the Philosophy of History"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/benjaminTheses.pdf) (1940/74), Arendt's [*The Human Condition*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/arendtHumanCondition.pdf) (1958), Merleau-Ponty's ["Eye and Mind"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/merleauPontyEyeMind.pdf) (1961/93), Barthes's ["From Work to Text"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/barthesText.pdf) (1971/77), Foucault's [*The Archaeology of Knowledge*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/foucaultArchaeology.pdf) (1969/72), Williams's [*Television*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/williamsTelevision.pdf) (1975), Cixous's ["The Laugh of the Medusa"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/cixousMedusa.pdf) (1975/76), Lorde's ["Uses of the Erotic"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeErotic.pdf) (1978/84) and ["The Mater's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeTools.pdf) (1979/81), Kristeva's [*Powers of Horror*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/kristevaAbjection.pdf) (1982), Butler's [*Gender Trouble*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/butlerGT.pdf) (1990), Moten's [*In the Break*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/motenBreak.pdf) (2003), Sedgwick's [*Touching Feeling*](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/sedgwickTF.pdf) (2003), Chun's ["Did Somebody Say New Media?"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/chunNewMedia.pdf) (2006) and ["The Enduring Ephemeral"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/chunEnduringEphemeral.pdf) (2008), Doane's ["The Indexical and the Concept of Medium Specificity"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/doaneIndexical.pdf) (2007), Grosz's ["The Thing"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/groszThing.pdf) (2001), Brown's ["Thing Theory"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/brownBillThing.pdf) (2001), Appadurai's ["The Thing Itself"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/appaduraiThing.pdf) (2006), Haraway's ["Situated Knowledges"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/harawaySituated.pdf) (1988), and Barad's ["Posthumanist Performativity"](http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/baradPP.pdf) (2003). (I've excluded Debray and Krauss, since we haven't discussed them.) 

Soon, we'll discuss who is missing from this outline and which works and perspectives should be added to it. I'm looking forward to that. For now, the questions . . .
