We acknowledge and respect the Songhees, Esquimalt, and WSÁNEĆ peoples on whose traditional territories the University of Victoria stands and whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

## Acknowledgment of Influence 

I would like to thank Carolyn Allen, Kate Cummings, and Shannon Mattern, whose pedagogy and courses influenced the design and content of this seminar.
