This seminar is based on a portfolio model of research, where you write consistently throughout the term and revise your work at the end. It also includes two brief presentations.  

## Portfolio

I am asking you to develop a portfolio of eight response papers over the course of the seminar. Each response paper should: 
 
* Be somewhere between 450- and 500-words-long, 
* Use a citation style of your choice (MLA, APA, Chicago/Turabian, Harvard), 
* Be polished, with concise treatments of critical theory, 
* Avoid frequent quotation and instead use clearly deliberate selections of textual evidence, 
* Articulate the relevance of the assigned reading in your own words,   
* Refrain from a significant amount of comparing and contrasting and instead stress why the relations (or differences and similarities) between two or more works matter (e.g., the social or cultural implications of differences, the assumptions motivating arguments, the effects of a certain logics or definitions, or the tendencies of particular styles or methodologies), and 
* Be submitted electronically. (I'll provide details during seminar.)

Six of your eight response papers should draw on work by a pair of assigned authors and address the following questions without much, if any, reference to other materials/sources: 
>How are media defined in this instance? Under what assumptions about matter and materiality? And to what effects on interpretation? 

Here, "this instance" implies the pairing of two authors. When addressing these questions, you are welcome to privilege a particular work over others assigned for the week, especially if you find one of the works more compelling or it's difficult to synthesize two or more works in 450-500 words. That said, each of these six response papers should somehow account for a pair of authors and put their work into dialogue where possible. None of the papers should be dedicated to one person or focus on a single work, and each of them should be submitted *prior* to the seminar meeting dedicated to the texts at hand. 

One of your eight response papers should address the following questions: 

>In terms of assigned texts and/or discussion, what is a specific gap in the course outline for "Media and Materiality"? Who are two authors who are not included here but whose work contributes to our discussions? How do they define media, under what assumptions about matter and materiality, and to what effects on interpretation? 

When responding to this particular set of questions, I recommend selecting one publication (or excerpt) by each of your two authors. This way, you don't tackle too much for a short response. Of course, this particular paper requires research beyond the assigned reading. However, I will dedicate discussion to your observations throughout the seminar, and I will make time for us to consider absences from this course outline. This paper may be submitted at any point before *29 November 2016*.

Additionally, one of your eight response papers should consist of:  

>A keyword entry (see Raymond Williams) on "media" in the writing style of an assigned author.  

Yes, I'm asking you to imitate an author's style, but I'm also asking you to follow the parameters of the keyword genre. The motivation for this exercise is to experiment with the intersection of expression and convention while also familiarizing yourself with a style other than your own (and its relation to scholarship). For this particular paper, you may select any of our assigned authors, and I recommend reading a few of Williams's keyword entries. You may also want to read additional work by your selected author, together with entries in keywords projects inspired by Williams (e.g., *Keywords for American Cultural Studies* and *New Keywords: A Revised Vocabulary of Culture and Society*). I encourage you to have fun with this one, and please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about it. This paper may be submitted at any point before *29 November 2016*.

Please note: you may submit no more than one response paper per week. With eight papers and twelve seminar meetings, this means you do not need to write a paper for every seminar meeting. It also gives you some flexibility, allowing you to decide which paper to write when.  

The portfolio is due by *13 December 2016*. It should include revised versions of your eight response papers plus a brief cover letter, for which I will provide instruction in late October or early November. For revisions, I recommend using something like track changes to visualize or document your edits. 

I will assess your portfolio, with feedback, three times during the term. For details, see [Assessment](assessment.html).

## Presentations 

I am also asking you to give two brief presentations during the term. Each presentation should: 

* Provide a brief interpretation (no more than three minutes) of an assigned reading, including how it articulates media and materiality, together with your response to the reading (e.g., its assumptions, where it's persuasive, and what questions it raises),
* Include one (and only one) question you have for the seminar about the text at hand (we will write this question on the board for reference throughout the seminar), 
* Not include slides (if only to reduce your workload and treat the seminar more like a conversation), and 
* Involve your active role in facilitating seminar discussion after your brief interpretation of an assigned text. 

During each seminar meeting, two of you will present, and we will schedule the presentations during our first meeting. The presentations will usually occur during the first hour of seminar.   

For the two presentations, you will receive a single mark. For details, see see [Assessment](assessment.html).
